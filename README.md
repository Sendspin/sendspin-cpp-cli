# sendspin-cpp-cli

A headless **CLI / daemon audio player** built on the
[sendspin-cpp](https://github.com/Sendspin/sendspin-cpp) synchronized
audio-streaming library, taking its command-line and control ergonomics from
[squeezelite](https://github.com/ralph-irving/squeezelite).

> **Status: early scaffold.** This repository is being stood up as an *epic*.
> The initial task brings up the build and boots a sendspin client; feature work
> is tracked in [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## What it is

Like squeezelite is a headless endpoint for Lyrion/Logitech Media Server,
`sendspin-cli` is a headless endpoint for the **Sendspin** protocol: it
advertises itself over mDNS (`_sendspin._tcp`), is discovered, and is driven by
a remote sendspin *controller* — while a small, squeezelite-style flag set
configures identity, audio output, discovery, logging, and daemonization. A
local control channel (socket / subcommands) is planned so you can also drive it
from the same host.

- **Library:** sendspin-cpp (`player` role; FLAC / Opus / PCM), pulled via CMake
  `FetchContent`.
- **Audio out:** an `AudioSink` seam — ALSA as the default Linux/Docker backend,
  a null/stdout sink for device-less containers, and PortAudio for cross-platform
  development.
- **Binary:** `sendspin-cli`.

## Build

Requires **CMake ≥ 3.16**, a **C++20** compiler, and network access on the first
configure. sendspin-cpp is pulled in with `FetchContent` at a pinned tag, and it
fetches its own dependencies (ArduinoJson, micro-flac, micro-opus, IXWebSocket) in
turn. No audio libraries are needed yet — the only output backend in this build is
device-less.

> C++20 rather than C++17: sendspin-cpp's host build declares
> `target_compile_features(sendspin PUBLIC cxx_std_20)`, so the requirement
> propagates to anything that links it.

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/sendspin-cli --help
```

To build against a different version of the library:

```bash
cmake -B build -DSENDSPIN_GIT_TAG=v0.7.0
```

## Run

`sendspin-cli` is a listener: it starts a WebSocket server and waits for a Sendspin
server to drive it. Until mDNS advertisement lands, either point your server at
`ws://<this-host>:8928/sendspin` or dial it from here with `-s`.

```bash
# Listen on the default port, discard audio — verifies the client boots and connects
./build/sendspin-cli -n living-room

# Dial a server, and pipe raw PCM to ALSA to actually hear it
./build/sendspin-cli -s 192.168.1.10 -o stdout | aplay -f cd

# Debug logging, in the foreground
./build/sendspin-cli -d debug
```

The flags follow squeezelite's: `-o` output device, `-l` list devices, `-n` name,
`-s` server, `-z` daemonize, `-P` pidfile, `-d`/`-f` logging. Run `--help` for the
current state of each — several are scaffolding whose real behaviour is still to come.

## Roadmap

See [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the epic breakdown and the child
tasks that build out audio backends, discovery, daemonization, the local control
channel, Docker packaging, and more.
